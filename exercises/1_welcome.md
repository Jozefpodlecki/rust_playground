# Welcome to Rust Playground Project!

I‚Äôve prepared a series of coding exercises in Rust, covering a variety of topics and difficulties.
They're not meant to be a strict learning path, but rather a collection of challenges you can explore at your own pace‚Äîsome are practical, others just for fun.

Happy coding! ü¶Ä

## üõ†Ô∏è First Task

Let's start off with a program that saves a file named `result.json` with the following fields:

- `name`: The name of your package
- `created_on`: the current UTC timestamp
- `version`: `"1.0"`

You might need `serde` for serialization and `chrono` to generate the timestamp.
